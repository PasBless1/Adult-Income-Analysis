### **Adult Income Analysis Project**

**Repository Overview:**
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and dataset used in the "Adult Income Analysis" project. The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning to predict whether individuals earn above or below $50,000 annually based on demographic and employment data. This analysis can aid policymakers and organizations in understanding economic factors and contributing to workforce development initiatives.

### **Project Details:**

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleaned and normalized the dataset to ensure accurate analysis. Techniques included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Conducted detailed exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of various features and their relationship with income levels.
- Visualized key insights using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to illustrate demographic and economic factors influencing income.

**Predictive Modeling:**
- Implemented several machine learning models including logistic regression and random forest to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year.
- Tuned models for optimal performance using grid search and cross-validation techniques.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provided a detailed comparison of model outcomes to select the best performer for deployment.

**Insights and Recommendations:**
- Highlighted key predictors of income level and discussed implications for economic and workforce development.
- Suggested targeted actions for policymakers to address income disparities based on predictive insights.
